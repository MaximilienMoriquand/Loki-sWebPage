  <p class="title">What is Loki</p>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
        Loki is a simple and easy to use IDE to code in Java.
        When we created Loki, we wanted to make it as easy as possible to use so that anyone that wanted to use it could without searching hours in the documentation.
        As we just said, this IDE is made to code and run Java code, but you can of course edit all the documents of your projects.
    </p>

  <p class="title">Who are we ?</p>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
        We are a group of students that created this IDE as a group project.
        We based our IDE design to some of our experiences with some tools like Vim or IntelliJ.
        Thats why we decided to create an very simple IDE that has some IntelliJ features but is as simple as Vim to Use.

    <p class="title">Create a project</p>
    <div class="box">
    <p>
        You can choose to create a project with or without Maven and Git.
        This depends of the type of projects that you want to do.
        You can also change this by adding some Git files or a pom.xml file in the project architecture.
    </p>
  </div>
  -->
  <p class="title">Open a project</p>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
        You can of course open any projects that you want with the IDE and edit any file of your choice.
        When opening a project, the IDE will automatically detect if this is a Maven project or if your project has some git files.
        Thats why you won't have any manipulations to do to make the IDE detect that.
